Some things, like the fuel gauge, are directly hooked up to sensors in the car (i.e. not the CAN bus). I managed to change data bound for the speedo, the tacho (RPM guage) and the engine temperature gauge. (I believe some other warning lights are also addressable but, at this point, I haven&apos;t found their identities - eg ABS &amp; traction control - as I haven&apos;t had the RPi secured well enough to, er, engage the traction control to the point it flashes a warning at me!)</p><p>Hence the CrikeyCon challenges available today are based on those three gauges.

As long as they&apos;re roadworthy and as safe as they can be for their vintage, why shouldn&apos;t we use the carbon debt we&apos;ve already incurred in the manufacture of that vehicle by keeping it running? But I digress... food for another post.</p><p>Anyway, I managed to find similar instrument cluster for the early CAN bus enabled model of car that I already own. I wondered, <strong>could I &apos;record&apos;</strong> the the CAN bus of the traffic on my car and <strong>&apos;play it back&apos; on my replacement instrument cluster </strong>that I bought from the wreckers?</p><p>And if so... <strong>can I tweak the replay of traffic </strong>to show what I want instead?</p><p>This is all good and fine as a side-project. But I opened my mouth around the CrikeyCon crew about adding a &quot;car hacking village&quot; sometime soon... and the level of support I got for this idea was amazing. It had to be done!</p><p>...more on the setup of the CTF challenges as we draw closer to the Con (on the 3rd September 2022).</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
