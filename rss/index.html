Drones/UAVs. Submarines. Planes. Sharks with lasers. The <strong>interest levels in hacking things that move is rising</strong>. Autohackers.com has been formed to meet this challenge. </p><p>This year <strong>at CrikeyCon</strong> we&#x2019;re starting with <strong>some basics</strong> &#x2013; <strong>understanding</strong> the automotive <strong>CAN bus</strong>, with a capture from a vehicle and an instrument cluster from the same, to &#x2018;replay&#x2019; the drive. See and learn the CAN interactions using can-utils on a RPi+PICAN3 and see if <strong>you can make the instrument cluster dance</strong> to your tune&#x2026;</p><hr><p>We&apos;re going to be joining Droppy at CrikeyCon (yay!) for our inaugural appearance for car hacking... and we are very excited to start with such a bang! Though hopefully not too literal a bang... &lt;checks voltage setting on the PSU&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve been looking at ways to start &quot;car hacking&quot; for a while, with the underlying reason that I want to be able to fix, modify and upgrade (aka &apos;hack&apos; in the old school definition of the word) older cars that we own that aren&apos;t ready for the scrap heap. As long as they&apos;re roadworthy and as safe as they can be for their vintage, why shouldn&apos;t we use the carbon debt we&apos;ve already incurred in the manufacture of that vehicle by keeping it running? But I digress... food for another post.</p><p>Anyway, I managed to find similar instrument cluster for the early CAN bus enabled model of car that I already own. I wondered, <strong>could I &apos;record&apos;</strong> the the CAN bus of the traffic on my car and <strong>&apos;play it back&apos; on my replacement instrument cluster </strong>that I bought from the wreckers?</p><p>And if so... <strong>can I tweak the replay of traffic </strong>to show what I want instead?</p><p>This is all good and fine as a side-project. But I opened my mouth around the CrikeyCon crew about adding a &quot;car hacking village&quot; sometime soon... and the level of support I got for this idea was amazing. It had to be done!</p><p>...more on the setup of the CTF challenges as we draw closer to the Con (on the 3rd September 2022).</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
