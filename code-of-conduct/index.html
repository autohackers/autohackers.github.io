As a security event organiser, we believe these events should represent a safe, enjoyable and inclusive environment for all people, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexuality, religion, disability, socio-economic background, experience, etc.</p><p>No one should be subject to any harassment, bullying or abuse. Any such behaviour will not be tolerated, and we will take such action as we deem necessary to prevent recurrence. This may include immediate removal from an event and a prohibition from attending future events. </p><p>This code of conduct explains what we mean by unacceptable behaviour and it outlines the steps someone subjected to such behaviour at an event can take to report it.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-need-a-code-of-conduct">Why do we need a Code of Conduct?</h3><p>Unfortunately, unacceptable behaviour occurs at cybersecurity events worldwide. When the IN Security Movement surveyed over 2,000 women in 2018, they found that one in four women experienced sexual harassment and over 40% were on the receiving end of inappropriate behaviour. Reportedly, this has further increased dissatisfaction amongst women as many feel disenfranchised and threatened. It has also resulted in event non-attendance. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to get participants fully aligned on what constitutes unacceptable behaviour, how it can be reported, and what will be done about it.</p><h3 id="who-is-subject-to-our-code-of-conduct-for">Who is Subject to our Code of Conduct for?</h3><p>Our code of conduct is for event attendees, speakers, sponsors, partners, facilities staff, committee, and board members.</p><h3 id="how-we-define-acceptable-and-unacceptable-behaviour">How we Define Acceptable and Unacceptable Behaviour</h3><p>People’s interpretation of acceptable or unacceptable behaviour is subjective and can be influenced by a number of factors including personal experience, religion and cultural background. That’s why we believe it’s important to define what we mean by both.</p><p><strong>Acceptable Behaviour</strong></p><p>As an event organiser, we expect everyone to be professional and respectful to others at all times. Everyone should be aware of the impact their behaviour can have on others. We ask that you:</p><ul><li>Respect the venue, the staff and any equipment you may be allowed to use.</li><li>Be courteous and well-mannered when speaking to someone or engaging with them.</li><li>Treat people the same way you would like to be treated.</li><li>Respect someone’s personal space and body – when someone says no it is no, not maybe.</li></ul><p><strong>Unacceptable Behaviour</strong></p><p>Unacceptable behaviour is offensive in nature – it may disturb or upset an individual or make them feel threatened.</p><p>It can include:</p><ul><li>Derogatory, inflammatory or discriminatory language, comments or conduct.</li><li>Engineered episodes of intimidation, aggressive actions or repeated gestures.</li><li>Repetitive heckling and disruption of talks.</li><li>Clothing staff or volunteers in inappropriate attire e.g. sexualised clothing.</li><li>Using sexual images or sex toys in public spaces.</li><li>Inappropriate photography or recordings.</li><li>Stalking or following.</li><li>Persistent and unwanted sexual advances.</li><li>Bullying behaviour.</li><li>Unwanted physical contact.</li><li>Encouraging any of the above behaviours.</li></ul><h3 id="how-to-report-unacceptable-behaviour">How to Report Unacceptable Behaviour</h3><p><strong>Option 1.</strong> <strong>Speak up.</strong> If you are disrespected, or witness this happening to someone else, engage politely with the person involved, if you feel able to, and let them know that you find their behaviour unacceptable and offensive. Sometimes the best way to change unacceptable behaviour is by bringing it to the perpetrator’s attention and giving them an opportunity to acknowledge this and apologise.</p><p><strong>Option 2.</strong> <strong>Report it to us</strong> via any of the following ways:</p><ul><li>Inform a member of our event staff.</li><li>Email us at safety@autohackers.org</li></ul><p>When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible, including:</p><ul><li>Your name and contact details (email, cell/mobile phone and address). </li><li>The time it occurred.</li><li>The place it occurred.</li><li>The names and contact details of any witnesses.</li><li>The outcome you are expecting (e.g., letter of apology, steps taken to prevent a similar instance from occurring etc..)</li></ul><p><em>Note</em>: providing your personal information is optional when reporting.</p><p>We don’t have a time limit for reporting unacceptable behaviour, although we encourage you to do it as quickly as possible, as it can be difficult to obtain accurate witness statements the longer time passes. If you report unacceptable behaviour more than 3-months after an incident, you should explain why as it may impact the ability to respond accordingly. We will consider your explanation and then endeavour to deal with your report.</p><h3 id="how-we-handle-unacceptable-behaviour">How we Handle Unacceptable Behaviour</h3><p>We are committed to ensuring that you and other attendees experience a positive, enjoyable and inclusive event. We strive for customer service excellence when reporting unacceptable behaviour. That’s why, for the duration of our event, we will have a number of reporting mechanisms available (e.g., suitable informed event staff, event feedback forms etc.). When you report unacceptable behaviour to us, we will respond promptly and with care, consideration and respect.</p><p>Our process does not replace nor remove the formal mechanisms available to you as an individual to report inappropriate or offensive behaviour; such as making a police report.</p><h3 id="our-process-is-as-follows">Our Process is as Follows: </h3><ul><li>We will acknowledge your report and reply via email within 30 minutes, during an event (such as conference or meetup), or within 1 business day during other times.</li><li>We will perform a thorough investigation within 2 weeks. We will keep it wholly professional and confidential. We will treat all of the people involved fairly and objectively, irrespective of what our relationship with them is. </li><li>We will take appropriate action e.g., issue warnings, give direction to learning resources on the topic of harassment, bullying or anti-social behaviour, enforce temporary or permanent suspensions, and if necessary, make a report to the police. We will take into consideration your wishes in any enforcement of the Code of Conduct. </li><li>We will suggest measures we can take to try to ensure incidents of this nature do not reoccur at future events and implement those which are appropriate to the specific event. </li><li>We reserve the right to remove people from the event or prevent people from joining the event. </li><li>We will not name and shame individuals, but we will analyse our progress with regards to unacceptable behaviour and publish our findings annually on our website.</li></ul>
